This is the code from my Matura Project: From Theory to Reality: Exploring Quantum Computing and Running Grover's search algorithm on a Real Quantum Computer.
The following Code are uploaded:
-Grover search algorithm with QCrircuits, Qsikit with and without error and with the IBM Brisbane.
-The magic square game.
-code for plotting the Bloch sphere with qiskit and matplotlib.
-my databases with one oliver in it.
-the classical approach of seraching through an unsorted database.
-drawing a quantum circuit.
